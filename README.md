# fanwhy
fanwhy is a small command-line tool for Linux that helps you understand why your laptop or PC fan is spinning up. It samples CPU load, top CPU-hungry processes, and (optionally) temperature sensors, then prints a concise summary so you can see which processes and components are most likely responsible for high fan activity.
